    "text": "My name is Mrityunjay Kumar (MJ). I am a PhD student (Part-time) at IIIT Hyderabad Software Engineering Research Center. I am also a full-time employee (currently on sabbatical) at Zenoti, a category leader Enterprise SaaS product company in beauty and wellness vertical.\n\n\nFor my PhD, I am focusing on understanding why new college hires in SaaS product companies take time to become productive, and how an undergraduate CS education can be augmented to equip them to do better. The problem statement comes from my personal experience of hiring and managing campus (and 1-3 years experienced) candidates and working with other managers who do so. My thesis is intended to devise a pedagogical approach to teach modeling and other skills required to address this problem, and demonstrate that such interventions can work well. We believe pedagogy of Algodynamics can be a good starting point.\n\n\n\nI am interested in education research in general, and Computer Science Education in particular - teaching, learning and curriculum aspects. I love to teach, coach and mentor - professionally and personally.\nUnder the guidance of my adviser Prof. Venkatesh Choppella, I have been studying learning theories applicable to Virtual Labs, applying pedagogy of Algodynamics to teaching algorithms, and most recently, formulating an approach to teach application software modeling through Algodynamics.\nGoogle Scholar\n\n\n\nI am interested in many other areas, you can find my writings about Career Management and Being Critical here. I am involved with startup community in a limited fashion, currently working as a volunteer to curate annual SaasBoomi build event, a community-driven, founder-helping-founder ecosystem for SaaS companies in India to help build a product nation. I also help out a little bit around career counselling and teaching with Udayancare Hyderabad chapter and hope to do much more in this space.\nMy LinkedIn profile shows my professional interests and experience."
